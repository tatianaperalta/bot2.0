# bot2.0
This is a two-way message bot.


This bot is capable of:
- sending whatsapp messages to new contacts, (using a .cvs file)
- identifying and openning unread messages on whatsapp, (by basic image recognition)
  - reading last message on that conversation,
  - procesing that message,
  - sending back the best answer to the message sent by user,


some improvements needed:
- coding while loop, to reach one by one all of the contacts in the storage file,
- fixing upper and lower case errors,
- working with sleep.time() 
- emoji integration
- UX conversation and word recognition,
